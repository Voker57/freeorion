## FUNCTIONAL_CENSUS_TAG_ORDER is a whitespace separated list, acts as a filter for which Tags will be presented 
## in Census pop-up, and specifies order in which they will be displayed.
## This list should not include any non-species tags, since those won't be displayed in the census anyway.

## FUNCTIONAL_SHIPYARD_BUILDING_LIST specifies those buildings which the MapWnd should recognize as shipyards
## Since currently the BLD_SHIPYARD_BASE is required for all more advanced shipyards to be functional,
## so it is the only one currently listed.
